# About this Repository

Hello, :earth_asia:!

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an educational community for :computer: programming. It provides :question: :pencil: :dart: on many programming languages. I aim to share my solutions mainly currently using Python >= 3.6.0 :snake:. No third party modules required. For each challenge in each kyu, I provide unittest. Note that they are not the best solutions ever made. My key interest include algorithms, data structures, and object oriented programming.

See my public profile [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/lukmanedwindra)
