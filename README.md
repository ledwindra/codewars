# About this Repository

Hello, world!

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an educational community for computer programming. It provides quizzes on many programming languages. I aim to share my solutions mainly currently using Python 3.x. No third party modules required. For each challenge in each kyu, I provide unittest. Note that they are not the best solutions ever made.
