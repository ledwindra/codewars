# About this Repository

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an educational community for computer programming. It is one of popular coding challenge platforms, and may be considered as one of the best -- at least according to this [Medium article](https://medium.com/coderbyte/the-10-best-coding-challenge-websites-for-2018-12b57645b654). It provides quizzes on many programming languages.

This repository aims to share my solutions for Codewars' coding challenges in Python. Note that they are not the best solutions ever made. Inputs are welcome, you can send me an [email](mailto:lukman.edwindra@gmail.com).
