There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

```
find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
```

Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers. The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance. This is the first kata in series:

1. Find the unique number (this kata)
2. Find the unique string
3. Find The Unique
