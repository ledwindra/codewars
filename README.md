# About this Repository

Hello, :earth_asia:!

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an educational community for :computer: programming. It provides :question: :pencil: :dart: on many programming languages. Currently, I am using Python >= 3.6.0 :snake: to solve the problems. No third party modules required. For each challenge on each kyu, I provide [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). Note that they are not the best solutions ever made. My key interest include algorithms, data structures, and object oriented programming.

See my public profile [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/lukmanedwindra)

# Clone

Run the following on terminal:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ledwindra/codewars.git
cd codewars/
```

# Run test

Run the following on terminal:

```
cd [kyu-N]/[kata-path]/
python3 -m unittest test_[challenge_name].py
```

# Contribute

After cloning, run the following on terminal:

```
git checkout -b [your-branch-name]
git pull origin master
git add .
git commit -m [your-message]
git push origin [your-branch-name]
```

By pushing it to your branch, it will create a pull request on me. If passed the test, it will be merged to master. But what would someone do that anyway? :laughing: 

Anyway, thanks for reading and happy coding! :sunglasses:
